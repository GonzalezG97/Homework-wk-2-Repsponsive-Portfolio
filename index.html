      <p style="margin-right: 10px;"> Hello and welcome to my website! I am new to web development and created this to
        show off my projects and new skills. I worked in customer support for many big names in tech. I hope to use my
        ability to understand how the average customer thinks to the development side. Armed with this knowledge I plan
        to build applications and websites with the most common user issues in mind to help minimize user error.</p>
